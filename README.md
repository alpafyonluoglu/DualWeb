# Dual Web
Have two profiles for each website, login with two different accounts, and switch between them with one click!
Dual Web is a simple browser extension for Chromium-based browsers. It allows users to log into the same website with two
different accounts, which solves the problem of logging into websites that do not allow signing in with multiple accounts,
like GitHub, with both daily-use and corporate accounts, by using a light browser extension.

## Installation
1. Download and extract the extension files.
2. Visit extensions page of your browser. ([chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) for Google Chrome, [edge://extensions](edge://extensions) for Microsoft Edge)
3. Enable developer mode.
4. Click on "Load unpacked".
5. Select the folder containing extension files.  

Once the extension is installed, click on the extension icon, which appears on the right side of the URL bar, and
click "Switch" to switch to the other profile. Do the same to switch back to the first profile later.
